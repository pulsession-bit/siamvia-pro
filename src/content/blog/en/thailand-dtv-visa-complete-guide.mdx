Launched in July 2024, the **Destination Thailand Visa (DTV)** is a real revolution for remote workers and enthusiasts of Thai culture. Designed to attract international talent and boost the digital economy, this visa offers unprecedented flexibility to legally stay in the Land of Smiles.

## What is the DTV visa?

The DTV is a long-term visa with the following main features:

- **Validity**: 5 years
- **Stay duration**: Up to 180 days per entry
- **Multiple entries**: You can leave and return as many times as you want for 5 years
- **Extension**: Possibility to extend each stay by an additional 180 days while in the country (fee is approximately 1,900 THB)

## Two paths to get it: Workcation or Soft Power

### 1. The Workcation Path (Remote Work)

This is aimed at **digital nomads**, **freelancers**, and **employees of companies based outside of Thailand**.

**Required documents:**
- Employment contract with a foreign employer
- Professional portfolio
- Proof of freelance activity (website, profile on platforms like Upwork or Fiverr)

> **Important**: It is strictly forbidden to work for a Thai company or conduct local business with this visa.

### 2. The Soft Power Path (Cultural Activities)

If you do not work remotely, you can obtain the DTV by participating in approved activities:

- **Sports**: Learning Muay Thai or other martial arts
- **Gastronomy**: Thai cooking classes
- **Health**: Long-term medical treatments
- **Events**: Seminars, music festivals, or art exhibitions

## The financial requirement: the pillar of your application

This is the point most scrutinized by the authorities. You must prove that you have at least **500,000 THB** (around 15,000 USD/EUR) in a personal bank account.

### Common pitfalls that lead to rejection

| Pitfall | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Funds are not "old" enough | The money must have been in the account for **at least 3 months** (some embassies require 6 months). A massive transfer right before applying often leads to a refusal. |
| Non-liquid assets | Only immediately available cash (checking or savings accounts) is accepted. **Cryptocurrencies, stocks, or real estate** do not count. |
| Joint accounts | The account must strictly be in your personal name only. |

## Taxes: what you need to know

The DTV has significant tax implications if you stay in Thailand for extended periods:

- **The 180-day rule**: If you spend more than 180 days in Thailand within a calendar year, you become a **Thai tax resident**.
- **Territorial taxation**: According to the Thai system, only foreign-sourced income **transferred into Thailand** is taxable. Income kept in a foreign bank account is not taxed by Thailand.

> Tip: Consult a specialized tax advisor before exceeding 180 cumulative days of stay within a calendar year.

## Pitfalls to avoid and practical advice

1. **Applying outside Thailand is mandatory**: You cannot apply for the DTV from within Thailand. You must be abroad (in your home country or a neighboring country like Laos).

2. **Administrative strictness**: Minor errors (forgetting a middle name, inconsistencies with the passport) can lead directly to a **rejection with no refund** of the application fee (around 350-400 USD).

3. **Family**: Your spouse and children under 20 can accompany you as dependents with their own DTV visa.

4. **Mandatory Insurance**: A [travel insurance covering Thailand](/en/thailand-travel-insurance) with a minimum of 50,000 USD coverage is highly recommended and sometimes required depending on the embassy.

## In summary

The DTV is **the most economical and flexible option** to test living in Thailand long-term, provided you have the necessary savings and respect the rules regarding remote work.
