          {
            "q": "Do I need a visa to go to Thailand?",
            "a": "It depends on your nationality and the length of your stay. Many travelers can enter Thailand without a prior visa thanks to a visa exemption, for a limited tourist stay. Beyond this duration, or for certain purposes (long stay, remote work, retirement), a visa is mandatory."
          },
          {
            "q": "What is the difference between visa exemption and tourist visa?",
            "a": "Exemption allows entry without prior application, but with a shorter duration and less flexibility. The tourist visa requires an application before departure, but allows a longer stay and possible extension. Neither authorizes work."
          },
          {
            "q": "Which visa to choose to stay more than 90 days in Thailand?",
            "a": "For stays over 90 days, you should opt for a long-stay visa like the DTV (5 years), LTR (10 years), or Retirement visa (Non-O). Tourist visas are limited to a maximum of 90 days (60+30)."
          },
          {
            "q": "Can I enter Thailand without a visa and extend on site?",

          },
          {
            "q": "Can I change visa type once in Thailand?",
            "a": "In some cases, yes (e.g., Tourist to Retirement), but it is neither automatic nor guaranteed. Some conversions like to a DTV visa often require a new application from outside the country."

          {
            "q": "What is the maximum legal stay duration in Thailand?",
            "a": "With an Elite or LTR visa, up to 20 years. With a DTV, it's 180 days per entry (extendable). With a tourist visa, it's 90 days maximum."

          {
            "q": "How many times can I enter Thailand per year?",

            "q": "Do visa rules change often in Thailand?",

            "q": "Is remote work allowed in Thailand?",

            "q": "What is the difference between local work and remote work?",

          {
            "q": "How many times can I extend a visa?",

          {
            "q": "Do I need to leave the country to renew a visa?",
            "a": "For multi-entry visas (DTV, Elite), you must leave at the end of your authorized stay period (e.g., 180 days) to 'activate' a new entry. For single-entry visas, you must re-apply."

            "q": "Can I stay in Thailand for several years legally?",
