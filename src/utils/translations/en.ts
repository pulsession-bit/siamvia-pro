        { q: "Can I work on a Tourist Visa?", a: "No. Work is strictly forbidden on a tourist visa. This is the major advantage of the DTV Visa which legalizes your Digital Nomad status." },
        { q: "How long does it take to get the visa?", a: "Processing times vary by embassy. Generally: 3 to 10 business days for a tourist visa, and 5 to 15 business days for a DTV (as the file is more complex to verify)." },
        { q: "Does the money (500,000 THB) need to be blocked?", a: "For the DTV, money does not need to be blocked, but it must be visible on your bank statement at the time of application. You must show you have the funds." },
        { q: "What happens if my visa is refused?", a: "The embassy never refunds visa fees. That's why we recommend our Audit or Serenity Pack to check your file BEFORE payment to the embassy." },
        { q: "Can you guarantee visa approval?", a: "No agency can guarantee 100% the decision of a consular officer (it is illegal to claim so). However, we guarantee your file strictly respects the criteria, which maximizes your chances (99% success)." }
